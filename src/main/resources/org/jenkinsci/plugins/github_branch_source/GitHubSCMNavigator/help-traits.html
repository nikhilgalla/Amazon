    The behaviours control what is discovered from the GitHub server. The behaviours are grouped into a number
    of categories:
    <dl>
        <dt>Repository</dt>
        <dd>These behaviours determine what repositories get discovered. Only repositories that have at least one
            discovered branch / pull request can themselves be discovered.
        </dd>
        <dt>Within repository</dt>
        <dd>These behaviours determine what gets discovered within each repository. <strong>If you do not configure
            at least one discovery behaviour then nothing will be found!</strong></dd>
        <dt>General</dt>
        <dd>These behaviours affect the configuration of each discovered branch / pull request. 
        </dd>
    </dl>
